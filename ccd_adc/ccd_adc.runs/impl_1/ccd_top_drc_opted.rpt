REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 u_sync_fifo_cnt/fifo_buffer_reg has an input control pin u_sync_fifo_cnt/fifo_buffer_reg/ENARDEN (net: u_sync_fifo_cnt/fifo_buffer_reg_ENARDEN_cooolgate_en_sig_1) which is driven by a register (u_ccd_dirve/Wrreq_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.
